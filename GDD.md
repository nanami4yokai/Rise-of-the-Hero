Genre(s): RPG, singleplayer, Action-adventure, Base building, PvE, Sandbox, Simulation

Target audience: 12+

Unique Selling point(s): Combining the best of multiple worlds: active combat, deep lore and constant player development. 

Progression & Player Experience: The player is a simple guy, chosen by the Gods of Amarun to restore what was once lost in time - the great city of Mjolnir and its glory and importance on the continent. The player’s objective is to get out of the dungeon he spawns into, collect the beginners gear and meet the first NPC, which is to tell the player shortly about the history of the world and recent events. The main goal of the intro chapter is to meet the first god of the continent and accept their quest.  

Visual & Audio Style: For this game, I opted to go for a pixelated Hollow Knight, Cult of the Lamb, style. The atmosphere would induce the player into a fantasy world, thus encouraging him to continue on his adventures and feed his curiosity of what’s more to come. The visual effects would aid the mysterious vibe of the game and submerge the player in emotions like fear, curiosity, hope, excitement and many more.   

Game World Fiction: In the heart of the vast and distant continent named Amarun, a place seemingly forgotten by time, there was once a harmonious land where races of all kinds coexisted in joy and prosperity. Amarun was a realm blessed by seven ruler gods, each overseeing a facet of life that contributed to the well-being of its inhabitants.

Belogod, the god of the sun, cast his warm rays upon the land, providing light and life. Chernobog, the god of darkness, governed the mysteries of the night and the unseen. Perun, the king of gods and master of thunder, brought the power of storms to Amarun. Morana, the goddess of harvesting and witchcraft, ensured the bountiful yield of the land. Jarovit, the god of war, safeguarded the people in times of conflict. Aveta, the goddess of childbirth, watched over the cycle of life, and Sirona, the goddess of health, bestowed well-being upon the land.

However, the golden age of Amarun crumbled when discord gripped the hearts of the gods themselves. The divine pantheon, once united, descended into bitter conflicts over the dominion of the continent. As the gods clashed, so too did the rulers of the various regions, plunging Amarun into a devastating war. The once-harmonious land was torn asunder, and the majority of its inhabitants were swept away by the tides of chaos.

In the midst of this calamity, the capital city, Mjolnir, stood as a last bastion against the torrent of destruction. Despite the valor of its soldiers and the efforts of the local king, Kraj, Mjolnir ultimately succumbed to the cataclysmic events, leaving nothing but ruins and echoes of a bygone era.

A millennium passed, and Mjolnir lay dormant, a haunting reminder of the once-vibrant civilization that thrived in its streets. Then, from the ashes, emerged a brave hero, drawn to the desolate remnants of Amarun. With determination and courage, the hero rallied the remaining inhabitants, breathed life into the decaying city, and embarked on a quest to restore the former glory of Mjolnir.

Amidst the ruins, the hero uncovered long-lost secrets and encountered extraordinary personalities, each holding a piece of Amarun's intricate history. As new life blossomed on the once-barren continent, the hero faced challenges, formed alliances, and sought to mend the wounds inflicted by both gods and mortals. The journey of this valiant soul became a beacon of hope, promising the resurgence of Amarun from the shadows of its own tragic past.Long ago, the continent of Amarun was a prosperous and lively place, with different races living together in harmony, 

Platforms, Technology and Scope: The game is going to be aimed at PC players, with possibility of extending the scope to console players as well. It is going to be developed in Unity 2D, by a 1 person team. The project to be presented in the GMD course is just a part of a bigger project that I plan on developing even after the completion of the semester.

Game System & Interactivity: I imagine the game to be pretty interactive and provide guidance to the player whenever a new feature is introduced - imagine The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt hints in the beginning of the game. The NCP will also prove to be helpful, providing suggestive dialogues. The game will present a variety of gameplay features, from non-target combat to crafting, gathering and base-building. 

========================================================================

Since I was permitted to work on an already existing personal project of mine, it was decided for me to document the starting point of the GMD project. It was decided to treat the existing progress as 3rd party assets. 

Assets sprites (tilesets, interactive objects, NPCs, enemies and player (including animation frames));
Basic UI elements;
Scripts for the above mentioned assets.

========================================================================

GMD course milestones: The GMD course is to take place during the 6th semester, and requires to achieve 3 milestones. 
1st milestone: the dungeon (3-5 chambers including boss fight);
2nd milestone: the Old City (small portion);
3rd milestone: the Old Church of Belobog 

During these milestones, small features will also be developed, such as the combat system, UI interactions, object interactions, etc.
